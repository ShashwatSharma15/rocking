I love exploring new things, that's one the reasons why I want to be a part of this club. I had no prior coding knowledge of any sorts, so this coding week is helping me learn many new and interesting things. I like to keep myself busy and try to push my limits. Learning and developing interest in coding is my major motive from these recruitment tasks.
