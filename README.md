I love exploring new things, that's one the reasons why I want to be a part of this club. I had no prior coding knowledge of any sorts, so this coding week is helping me learn many new and interesting things. I like to keep myself busy and try to push my limits. Learning and developing interest in coding is my major motive from these recruitment tasks. 

Open Source is of immense use to developers as it helps us to work together on a project and thus increasing our efficiency. Contributing to it would mean I'll be help other developers around the world in there fields of work, which is something I would love to do.
